# Exploration-heavy Reinforcement Learning for Grid Environments

Just implementing and playing with RL algorithms, with a focus on exploration and novelty seeking, for grid environment with sparse rewards ([Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid) and potentially [Minihack](https://github.com/samvelyan/minihack) and [Crafter](https://github.com/danijar/crafter)).
